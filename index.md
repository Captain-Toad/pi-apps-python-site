## Pi Apps for Python

Pi Apps for Python is a front end for pi-apps (which can be found at Botspot's GitHub repo.)

From here on, I may refer to Pi Apps for Python as PAFP.

The main reason I am making this is because I love Pi Apps, but I am slightly irritated at yad's terrible draw times. It can take over 5 to 10 seconds to draw a single window. I am using a Python module named guizero, which is essentially Tkinter but with a simpler syntax. (It is based on Tkinter.) It has relatively fast loading times.

I will be heavily relying on the os module to run install/update scripts and get the contents of directories.

Installation for Pi Apps for Python is simple. I spent about an hour writing a fancy bash script to install PAFP. Clone the repo with:

`git clone https://github.com/captain-toad/pi-apps-python`.

Navigate to the new directory with:

`cd pi-apps-python`

Make install.sh executable with:

`chmod +x installer.sh`

And finally, run install.sh with:

`./installer.sh`.

If you want to do all of that in one command, try:

`git clone https://github.com/captain-toad/pi-apps-python && cd pi-apps-python && chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh`.

Just let everything install, and you're good to go!

##Versions
Pi Apps for Python is still in VERY early development. I started it today (Mar 19) and all I have done is written a basic title and window in the GUI, and an install script. I'll describe this development phase as `pre-prototype`.

I don't believe the .desktop shortcut works right now, so you may have to run it manually (`python3 ~/pi-apps/gui.py`).
